MvvmCrossiOSCustomWidget
========================

Attempting to create a custom iOS control using MvvmCross by sub-classing a UIView

Have tried to immitate the way that UITableviewCell and UICollectionViewCell in Xamarin allow sub-classing and customization. 

First prize would be to add the custom widget to a ViewController via Interface Builder!
